# ext_psychopathology_ABCD
The code in this repository details the analyses done for the publication "Investigating cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between brain structure and distinct dimensions of externalizing psychopathology in the ABCD Sample" co-first authored by Dr. Lee Propp and Hajer Nakua.

All the analyses were completed in R(4.0.3). There are two scripts in this repository:
1. data_preparation_and_cleaning.R <- outlines all the steps done to prepare the ABCD data (downloaded from NDA) for analysis.
2. data_analysis.R <- outlines all the functions used in the study to investigate the aims.
3. figure_creation.R <- outlines the functions created to develop the figures in the publication 

Code was written by both Hajer Nakua and Dr. Lee Propp (2022-2023)
